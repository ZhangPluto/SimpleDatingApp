# GitHub Rules 
# Attention!! Any submissions that do not follow the rules will be deleted!!
- Each programmer should fork this repository to their own GitHub, rather than committing code in this repository (the main repository or the upstream repository), any code committed directly in that repository **will be deleted**
- For each project change, the programmer should create a new git branch locally with the name of the branch for that change, **rather than in the master branch**
- For completed changes, you should first push the project to your personal code repository and create Pull Requests to the upstream repository, then merge them into the master branch of the main repository **after Code Review**.
## Remember! After updating the code in the upstream repository, you need to update the code in your own repository manually before submit a Pull Request.
